Answers regarding questions to testing DFA with input
-----------------------------------------------------

> For each acceptance state of this DFA, indicate which token is recognized.

q0 accepts token B (epsilon)
q1 accepts token A ("a") 
q2 accepts token C ("b")
q3 accepts token B ("aa")
q4 accepts token A ("ab")
q5 accepts token C ("bb")

> Show which states the DFA goes through for the input abaabbaba. What tokens will be recognized?

Order of states : q0 -> q1 -> q4 -> q3 -> q0 -> q1 -> q4 -> q4 -> q3 -> q0 -> q2 -> q0 -> q1
Order of tokens : B ("aba"), B ("abba"), C ("b"), A ("a")

q0
->
q1 consumes "a", "baabbaba" 
->
q4 consumes "b", "aabbaba"
-> 
q3 consumes "a", "abbaba"

Final state, no potential transitions, restarts at initial state ( Token B recognized )

q0
->
q1 consumes "a", "bbaba"
->
q4 consumes "b", baba"
->
q4 consumes "b", "aba"
-> 
q3 consumes "a", "ba"

Final state, no potential transitions, restarts at initial state ( Token B recognized )

q0
->
q2 consumes "b", "a"

Final state, no possible transitions, restarts at initial state ( Token C recognized )

q0 
-> 
q1 consumes "a", epsilon

Finished input. ( Token A recognized )
